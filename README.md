# From_Scratch_Function_Approximation_Usign_Feedforward_Neural_Network
i built a multi layer neural network from scratch without using any third-party libraries. 
- feedforwrard 
- backpropagation with gradient descent 
- 4 activation functions 
- you can input your points and approximate them to a Continuous function with some visualization 
- you can run more then one learning thread to overcome slow Javascript
